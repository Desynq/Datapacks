# Slime Survival Datapack
Includes all the important functions, loot tables, recipes, advancements, dimensions, and worldgen used for the Slime Survival gamemode.

## Dependencies
* [Unvanilla](https://example.com)
* [DesynqLib](https://github.com/Desynq/DesynqLib)


## Compiling
1. The Unvanilla datapack folder should be renamed to `_a_Unvanilla` in order to shift it up to the top of the load order.
2. The DesynqLib datapack folder should be renamed to `_b_DesynqLib` in order to shift it up to the second highest in the load order.
3. The Slime Survival datapack should be fine although you should run the function `ss:core/initialize` upon first installing the datapack or any subsequent updates.
